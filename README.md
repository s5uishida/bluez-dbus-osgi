# bluez-dbus-osgi
This repository contains the MANIFEST.MF file of **the Eclipse plug-in project** for building OSGi bundle from the master branch of [bluez-dbus](https://github.com/hypfvieh/bluez-dbus) and the built bundle file. You need Java 8 or higher.

I would like to thank the author of this very useful bluez-dbus code, and everyone who has committed.
