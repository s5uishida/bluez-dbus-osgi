# bluez-dbus-osgi
This repository contains the MANIFEST.MF file for the OSGi bundle and the bundle file built from the master branch of [bluez-dbus](https://github.com/hypfvieh/bluez-dbus). You need Java 8 or higher.

I would like to thank the author of this very useful bluez-dbus code, and everyone who has committed.
