# bluez-dbus-osgi
This repository contains the MANIFEST.MF file of **the Eclipse plug-in project** for building OSGi bundle from the master branch of [bluez-dbus](https://github.com/hypfvieh/bluez-dbus) and the built bundle file. You need Java 8 or higher.

I use this with the following bundles.
- [SLF4J 1.7.26](https://www.slf4j.org/)
- [Apache Commons Lang 3.9](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/)
- [dbus-java-osgi 3.2.1-SNAPSHOT](https://github.com/hypfvieh/dbus-java)

I would like to thank the author of this very useful bluez-dbus code, and all the contributors.
